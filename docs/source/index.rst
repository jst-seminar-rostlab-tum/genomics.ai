Under the Gene Mapper all of your mappings are displayed. Click on the blue plus button to create a new one.

Here the Atlas and model type are set, scVI for the Pancreas for example.

On the last page the query datasets are selected. Either upload your own or select one of the existing ones.

Click on "Create Mapping", give it an appropriate name and submit.

A color-coded build status will appear with a progress bar. As soon as it's ready you can click on "See Results".





The users first login under their research institute and can upload query data. The data is then trained and ready to visualize.
